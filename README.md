A react to-do list app made to make the list of tasks to be done. 
You can make entries by typing your tasks in the input box and then click the "Add Goal" button to add the task.
Once the task is done or you don't want to do the task you can also delete the tasks only by clicking on them.
This is a simple project developed using React demonstrating key React concepts like components and state management.
